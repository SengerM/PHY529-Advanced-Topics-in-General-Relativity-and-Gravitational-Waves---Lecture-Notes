What is a gravitational wave

A gravitational wave is a solution to Einstein's equation in the weak field

Do we need the weak field limit? In this limit the waves are harmonic, are

 Gravitational waves are

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Transverse: We all know what it means, the same as an electromagnetic field.
 The perturbation that the wave produces is transverse with its direction
 of propagation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Traceless: The waves have equal and opposite effects in two perpendicular
 directions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A wave traveling in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\VERSOR z$
\end_inset

 direction produces relative motion in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\VERSOR x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\VERSOR y$
\end_inset

 directions of free masses.
 The motion in 
\begin_inset Formula $\VERSOR x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\VERSOR y$
\end_inset

 is identical (thus traceless waves).
 This are physical motions that can e.g.
 stretch a spring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A gravitational wave traveling through flat space has a metric 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
g_{\mu\nu}=\eta_{\mu\nu}+h_{\mu\nu}\label{Equation: metric with perturbation from a wave}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is the Minkowski metric and 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 a small perturbation.
 If the wave travels in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\VERSOR z$
\end_inset

 direction then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{\mu\nu}\sim\SQBRACKETS{\begin{matrix}0\\
 & a & b\\
 & b & -a\\

\end{matrix}}
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 represent the two possible polarizations of the wave.
 I.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_inset Formula $h_{+}\sim\SQBRACKETS{\begin{matrix}0\\

Detection of gravitational waves with Michelson interferometer

\begin_layout Standard
A

\end_inset

 (like the one used to prove that there was no ether) is ideal to detect
 changes in length in two orthogonal directions.
 It compares the time it takes light to travel each of the two arms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For light we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\DIFERENTIAL s^{2}=0\text{.}
\]

\end_inset

 From general relativity we also have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\DIFERENTIAL s^{2}=g_{\mu\nu}\DIFERENTIAL x^{\mu}\DIFERENTIAL x^{\nu}\text{.}
\]

\end_inset

 Let's consider the Michelson interferometer aligned with its arms in the
 
\begin_inset Formula $\VERSOR x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\VERSOR y$
\end_inset

 direction.
 If we look what happens to the light only in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\VERSOR x$
\end_inset

 direction then 
\begin_inset Formula $\DIFERENTIAL x^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\ne0$
\end_inset

 only for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=1$
\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
0=g_{11}\DIFERENTIAL x\DIFERENTIAL x\text{.}
\]

\end_inset

 Replacing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Equation: metric with perturbation from a wave"

\end_inset

 this is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
0=-c^{2}\DIFERENTIAL t^{2}+\PARENTHESES{1+h_{11}\PARENTHESES{\omega t-\VECTOR k\cdot\VECTOR x}}\DIFERENTIAL x^{2}\text{.}
\]

\end_inset

This can be seen as a modulation to the distance
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Can it also be seen as a modulation to the speed of light? I mean: 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\DIFERENTIAL x}{\DIFERENTIAL t}=\frac{c}{\sqrt{1+h_{11}\PARENTHESES{\omega t-\VECTOR k\cdot\VECTOR x}}}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 We can integrate 
\begin_inset Formula $\DIFERENTIAL t$
\end_inset

 to see how much time it takes light to travel some distance: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\intop_{0}^{\tau_{\text{out}}}\DIFERENTIAL t & =\frac{1}{c}\intop_{0}^{L}\sqrt{1+h_{11}}\DIFERENTIAL x\\
 & \approx\frac{1}{c}\intop_{0}^{L}\PARENTHESES{1+\frac{1}{2}h_{11}\PARENTHESES{\omega t-\VECTOR k\cdot\VECTOR x}+\dots}\DIFERENTIAL x
\end{align*}

\end_inset

 where in the second line 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{1+x}\approx1+\frac{x}{2}+\dots$
\end_inset

.
 This is the time it takes light to travel from 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

 to the end of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\VERSOR x$
\end_inset

 arm at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=L$
\end_inset

.
 There, there is a mirror so it bounces back so we have the same expression
 repeated.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\tau_{0\to L\to0}=\frac{2L}{c}+\frac{1}{2c}\intop_{0}^{L}h_{11}\PARENTHESES{\omega t-\VECTOR k\cdot\VECTOR x}\DIFERENTIAL x\text{.}\label{Equation: tau 0 L 0 in x}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the interferometer we are interested in the difference in time it takes
 light to travel each arm, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta\tau=\tau_{0\to L\to0}^{\VERSOR x}-\tau_{0\to L\to0}^{\VERSOR y}\text{.}
\]

\end_inset

The expression in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Equation: tau 0 L 0 in x"

\end_inset

 is for light traveling in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\VERSOR x$
\end_inset

 direction.
 In the 
\begin_inset Formula $\VERSOR y$
\end_inset

 direction it is the same but with 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{22}$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{11}$
\end_inset

.
 If we now consider (to make it simple) a wave propagating in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\VERSOR z$
\end_inset

 direction then we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{11}=-h_{22}=h
\]

\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta\tau=\frac{1}{c}\intop_{0}^{L}h\PARENTHESES{\omega t-\VECTOR k\cdot\VECTOR x}\DIFERENTIAL x\text{.}
\]

\end_inset

We can also consider the limit 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\omega\tau_{0\to L\to0}\ll1
\]

\end_inset

which is the same as considering the wavelength of the gravitational wave
 much bigger than the length of the arms of the interferometer or 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
kL\ll1\text{. }
\]

\end_inset

 In this limit we can regard 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 as constant along the integration, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h\PARENTHESES{\omega t-\VECTOR k\cdot\VECTOR x}\approx h\PARENTHESES{\omega t}
\]

\end_inset

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\intop_{0}^{L}h\DIFERENTIAL x=hL$
\end_inset

.
 So finally 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta\tau=h\PARENTHESES t\frac{2L}{c}\text{.}\label{Equation: sa7td89gasdoasgyou}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau$
\end_inset

 is basically the signal that we will measure, so increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 also increases the signal

Increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 also increases the signal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is true in the 
\begin_inset Formula $L\ll\lambda$
\end_inset

 limit.
 Anyway, for a 
\begin_inset Formula $1\KILO{Hz}$
\end_inset

 signal we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1\KILO{Hz}}\approx300\KILO m$
\end_inset

 so current detectors (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim5\KILO m$
\end_inset

) are still well within that limit.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 That is the reason for making very big interferometers.
 The limiting factor for the size of the current detectors is the money

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The freely falling masses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As stated before, a gravitational wave induces a relative movement between
 freely falling masses.
 In the Michelson interferometer these masses should be the beam splitter
 and the mirrors in the end of each arm.
 If these elements are attached to the ground, they are the opposite to
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

freely falling masses
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If this were the case, when the gravitational wave arrives it will try
 to change the distance between them but the other forces would compensate
 this and they would not move.
 So the mirrors and the beam splitter have to be mounted in some special
 way such that they can be regarded as free masses.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To accomplish this they are suspended like pendulums (sophisticated pendulums).
 In the low angle regime the equation of motion for the pendulum is 
\begin_inset Formula $m\ddot{x}+kx=F_{\text{external}}$
\end_inset

 which in the 
\bar under
frequency domain
\bar default
 can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\PARENTHESES{-\frac{m}{k}\omega^{2}+1}x=\frac{1}{k}F_{\text{external}}\text{.}\label{Equation: pendulum in frequency domain}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Note here that for 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\gg\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$
\end_inset

 the dominant term is 
\begin_inset Formula $m\ddot{x}$
\end_inset

 so it behaves as a free mass while for 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\ll\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$
\end_inset

 the 
\begin_inset Formula $kx$
\end_inset

 term dominates and it keeps the mass fixed at a mean position.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Why pendulums and not springs?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Equation: pendulum in frequency domain"

\end_inset

 describes a mass attached to a spring, which is the small angle limit for
 a pendulum.
 Why using pendulums instead of springs? The reason is to reduce noise.
 In the case of the pendulum the 
\begin_inset Formula $\VERSOR x$
\end_inset

 component of the restoring force is a projection of the gravitational force
 exerted by the Earth, which is a conservative force.
 In the case of a spring, it is the mean force resulting after adding all
 the microscopic forces from the particles that make up the spring.
 Thus, it is to be expected that the spring is more noisy.

\begin{equation}

 Thus, it is crucial to understand and mitigate the noise sources.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Shot noise
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Michelson interferometer can be seen as a transducer that converts differences
 in length to differences in light power at its output.
 If the wavelength of the light is kept constant (and so the energy of the
 photons) then measuring the power is equivalent to counting the number
 of photons per unit time received.
 These photons follow a Poisson distribution with expectation value 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{P_{\text{out}}}{h\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 This introduces a fundamental source of noise with origin in quantum fluctuatio
ns.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{P_{\text{out}}}{h\nu}\ggg1$
\end_inset

 the Poisson distribution can be approximated by a Gaussian with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=\sigma^{2}=\frac{P_{\text{out}}}{h\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 In this limit we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\sigma}{\mu}=\sqrt{\frac{h\nu}{P_{\text{out}}}}
\]

\end_inset

 so making 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\text{out}}$
\end_inset

 as large as possible reduces the shot noise.
 There are a number of ways of accomplishing this, by increasing the laser
 power, using a 
\emph on
power recycling technique
\emph default
, etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Thermal noise
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As every system in the universe, here we also have thermal noise.
 It is indeed one of the strongest noise sources

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Thermal noise in a gravitational wave detector is a generalization of the
 
\emph on
Brownian motion
\emph default
.
 Each of the nearly free mirrors can be regarded as a very big Brownian
 particle.
 Air molecules hitting on them would induce small Brownian motion, that
 is why the mirrors are suspended in vacuum.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are still other sources that can induce Brownian motion.
 One of them is related to the materials used to hold the mirrors.
 This explains why mirrors are held with pendulum-like systems: the restoring
 force is the horizontal projection of gravity which, as a conservative
 force, lacks of thermal noise

 This makes the thermal noise coming from the holding mechanism negligible.

The biggest contribution to thermal noise are the internal degrees of freedom
 of the mirrors.
 Basically there are vibrations that introduce a noise spectrum starting

\end_inset

the best possible material
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for the mirrors and 2) lower the temperature.
 Current interferometers use mirrors made of 
\emph on
fused silica
\emph default
 at room temperature.
 Future interferometers are planning to use cryogenic systems instead.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another source of thermal noise is the coating of the mirrors.

Seismic noise
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is not hard to understand what this means and/or where it comes from.
 When seeking for such small displacements, every vibration that the Earth
 makes is important.
 Apparently, every part of the Earth's surface is continuously shaking with
 amplitudes of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim1\MICRO m$
\end_inset

 on time scales of seconds.
 If we are trying to measure magnitudes as stated in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Equation: DeltaL sobre L que queremos medir"

\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $L\sim1\KILO m$
\end_inset

, this 
\begin_inset Formula $1\MICRO m$
\end_inset

 shakes are almost infinite.
 There are two possibilities to fight against this noise: 1) somehow isolate
 our system and 2) go deep underground where the seismic noise is smaller.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Current detectors are all at ground level and use sophisticated pendulum
 systems to isolate the seismic noise.
 The best seismic noise attenuator to date (2013) is the one used in the
 Virgo detector, shown in

Gravitational waves arise in the linearized theory.
 The speed of gravity is the same as the speed of light.
 General relativity is highly non linear
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R\COVARIANTINDEX{\mu\nu}=-\frac{1}{2}g\COVARIANTINDEX{\nu\nu}R=\frac{8\pi G}{c^{4}}T\COVARIANTINDEX{\mu\nu}
\]

\end_inset

 Now we consider a weak field approximation, basically very far away from
 the sources.
 The waves are just perturbations to a time-independent background curvature.
 For this to hold the curvature radius has to be much greater than the wavelengt
h of the gravitational waves
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Does this mean that even on Earth (i.e.
 very far away from sources and in a relatively weak field) there is a regime
 for non linear waves?
\end_layout

\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{Time independent curvature radius}\gg\text{wavelength}
\]

\end_inset

 In this conditions the metric tensor can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g\COVARIANTINDEX{\mu\nu}=\eta\COVARIANTINDEX{\mu\nu}+h\COVARIANTINDEX{\mu\nu}
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is the Minkowski and 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is a small perturbation with 
\begin_inset Formula $\MODULE{h\COVARIANTINDEX{\mu\nu}}\ll1$
\end_inset

.
 Because our space is esentialy flat (linearized theory) then it holds 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\mu\nu}=\eta\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\mu\alpha}\eta\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\nu\beta}h\COVARIANTINDEX{\alpha\beta}
\]

\end_inset

 and so the inverse metric is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\mu\nu}=\eta\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\mu\nu}-h\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\mu\nu}\text{.}
\]

\end_inset

 Now I see 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

trace reversed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and it says 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\bar{h}\COVARIANTINDEX{\mu\nu}=h\COVARIANTINDEX{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{2}\eta\COVARIANTINDEX{\mu\nu}h
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $h=h\COVARIANTINDEX{\mu\nu}h\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 I don't know what this is.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a gauge freedom given by the infinitesimal transformation
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\mu}\to x\PRIME\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\mu}=x\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\mu}+\xi\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\mu}\PARENTHESES x
\]

\end_inset

 and this holds if 
\begin_inset Formula $\MODULE{\partial\COVARIANTINDEX{\mu}\xi\COVARIANTINDEX{\nu}}\ll\MODULE{h\COVARIANTINDEX{\mu\nu}}$
\end_inset

.
 This transformation modifies 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h\COVARIANTINDEX{\mu\nu}\PARENTHESES x\to h\PRIME\COVARIANTINDEX{\mu\nu}\PARENTHESES x=h\COVARIANTINDEX{\mu\nu}\PARENTHESES x-\PARENTHESES{\partial\COVARIANTINDEX{\mu}\xi\COVARIANTINDEX{\nu}-\partial\COVARIANTINDEX{\nu}\xi\COVARIANTINDEX{\mu}}
\]

\end_inset

Cannot read something in blue, next: 
\begin_inset Formula $\MODULE{h\PRIME\COVARIANTINDEX{\mu\nu}}\ll1$
\end_inset

.
 Now we choose the Lorentz (Hilbert) gauge which means 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h\COVARIANTINDEX{\mu\nu,\nu}=0
\]

\end_inset

 and as a result we have (the Einstein equation is this?)
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\PARENTHESES{-\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial^{2}t^{2}}+\nabla^{2}}\bar{h}\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\mu\nu}=-16\pi T\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\mu\nu}
\]

\end_inset

 where now we are using 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G=c=1\text{.}
\]

\end_inset

 In vacuum 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\square\bar{h}\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\mu\nu}=0
\]

\end_inset

 so this means that we will have plane wave solutions of the form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\bar{h}\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\mu\nu}=\mathscr{A}e\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\mu\nu}e^{ik\COVARIANTINDEX{\alpha}k\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\alpha}}
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 is the amplitude, 
\begin_inset Formula $e\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 is the polarization tensor and 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{i\dots}$
\end_inset

 is an exponential.
 
\begin_inset Formula $k\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 is the wave vector which is lightlike, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
k\COVARIANTINDEX{\mu}k\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\mu}=0\GRAY{\leftarrow\text{Lightlike}}
\]

\end_inset

 (because the wave travels at speed 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

).
 The polarization and wave vector are orthogonal, this means that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
e\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\mu\nu}k\COVARIANTINDEX{\nu}=0\GRAY{\leftarrow\text{Transverse waves}}
\]

\end_inset

 so this means that the waves are transverse.
 The degrees of freedom are 6 in total, I did not follow the explanation.
 The calculation is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
16\text{ components and gauge conditions}\rightarrow10-4=6\text{.}\GRAY{\leftarrow\text{Degrees of freedom}}
\]

\end_inset

 Transverse wave means 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

\]

\end_inset

 and this comes from 
\begin_inset Formula $e\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{0p}=0$
\end_inset

 (?).
 Traceless wave means that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
e\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX i\COVARIANTINDEX i=0\GRAY{\leftarrow\text{Traceless waves}}
\]

\end_inset

 and I am not sure where this comes from.
 We can use a transverse and traceless (TT) gauge for the metric and this
 will give us that there are two independent polarizations and trace-reversed
 metric 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\bar{h}\COVARIANTINDEX{\mu\nu}=h\COVARIANTINDEX{\mu\nu}\text{.}
\]

Let's now consider a wave propagating in the

 & e\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{xx}=-e\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{yy}

\end_inset

 The independent components are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\GRAY{\text{Two independent components}\rightarrow}\LBRACE{\begin{aligned} & e\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{xx}\DEF e^{\oplus}\equiv\text{plus polarization}\\
 & e\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{xy}\DEF e^{\otimes}\equiv\text{cross polarization}

\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If now we assume 
\begin_inset Formula $e\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{xy}=0$

 a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 In this case the line element has the form

\end_inset

 If we use the TT gauge (see before) this is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\DIFERENTIAL^{2}x\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX i}{\DIFERENTIAL\tau^{2}}=-\Gamma_{00}^{i}=-\frac{1}{2}\PARENTHESES{2h\COVARIANTINDEX{i0,0}-h\COVARIANTINDEX{00,i}}=0

Now we look at the equation of geodesic deviation, which (I believe) means
 how the separation of neighboring particles changes, i.e.
 it somehow means the tidal forces.
 This equation is

\frac{\DIFERENTIAL^{2}\xi}{\DIFERENTIAL\tau^{2}}=R\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX i\COVARIANTINDEX{0j0}\xi\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX j

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $R$

\begin_inset Formula $\xi\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX j\PARENTHESES 0=$

 something with

Black hole binaries
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Emission by black holes is actually easier to model than that of neutron
 stars because there is no matter.
 The models for sources with black holes are valid for any mass, it does
 not matter.
 With neutron stars this is not the case because if you have a model for
 neutron stars of mass 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 it may not hold for mass 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 because many things inside the neutron star change.

The higher frequency a black hole can emit is given by the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

quasi normal modes
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The peak frequency of a BNS system is lower than that of black holes.
 The reason is that the neutron stars are much bigger in size, so they 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

touch
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 before than the two black holes.
 They also have much more complicated quasi normal modes which have lower
 frequency.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are different flavors of black holes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Total mass.
 Depending on the total mass of the binary we can classify them like this:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Stellar mass BH.
 This is when 
\begin_inset Formula $3M_{\sun}<M_{BH}<100M_{\sun}$
\end_inset

.
 These are black holes formed from the decay of a star.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Intermediate mass BH.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $100M_{\sun}<M_{BH}<10^{5}M_{\sun}$
\end_inset

.
 These black holes do not form from supernova explosions.
 One mechanism for these black holes is merging of multiple black holes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Super massive BH.
 Those usually found in the center of the galaxies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Near solar mass BH.
 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{BH}<3M_{\sun}$
\end_inset

.
 These have not been observed yet.
 It would be a break through for dark matter.
 There is a minimum mass for black holes given by Hawking radiation, it
 it is smaller they would have already evaporate.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
The astrophysical sources of gravitational waves by binary black holes are
 intermediate mass black holes.
 This usually happens in the center of galaxies: The density of objects
 is bigger and also older so stars have already converted into black holes
 and black holes have already merged.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The higher the mass, the lower the peak frequency.
 Even if this may appear counter intuitive, the reason is that if there
 is more mass then the surface of the black hole is bigger and so the quasi
 normal modes (oscillations of its surface) have longer wavelength so lower
 frequency.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Supernovae 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The explosion of a star is not spherically symmetric (because the star rotates,
 and other effects) and because it is a very energetic process, it can emit
 gravitational waves detectable.
 The issue is that there is not a model for this type of wave basically
 because a supernova is a mess.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The detection of gravitational waves from supernovae (or neutrinos) is very
 important to understand what kind of object is left after such an event.
 The reason is that gravitational waves (and neutrinos) travel directly
 towards us without interactions, so it is a clean signal of what has happened.
 Light, which is what we use now to observe these events, scatters a lot
 with the matter of the dying star so it is very distorted.

This signal is supposed to be constantly present, though it has not a fixed

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can classify this background into two categories:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Population of point sources.
 This means that there are many events that happened in the history of the
 universe, and we see all of them superimposed.
 Analogy: the noise that the drops of water produce when it rains; you listen
 a continuous noise and not the individual events.
 This is expected to be between 
\begin_inset Formula $10\UNIT{Hz}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $4\KILO{Hz}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Cosmological.
 The anisotropies observed in the CMB are related with differences in the
 density of energy.
 This must have produced somehow a gravitational wave background similar
 to the CMB.
 Because this background is very red shifted, the peak frequency is very
 low to be observed nowadays.
 There are other models which propose a very high frequency despite the
 red shift.
 We really don't know yet.

 the stress-energy carried by the gravitational wave 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G^{\PARENTHESES 1}\COVARIANTINDEX{ij}\PARENTHESES{h^{\PARENTHESES 2}\COVARIANTINDEX{ij}}=\frac{8\pi G}{c^{4}}T^{\text{GW}}\COVARIANTINDEX{ij}\GRAY{\leftarrow\text{Stress-energy of a GW}}
\]

\end_inset

 We can also replace the 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{\PARENTHESES 2}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $G^{\PARENTHESES 2}\COVARIANTINDEX{ij}\PARENTHESES{h^{\PARENTHESES 1}\COVARIANTINDEX{ij}}$
\end_inset

 from the previous equation (I'm not following) so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T^{\text{GW}}\COVARIANTINDEX{ij}=\frac{c^{4}}{8\pi G}G^{\PARENTHESES 2}\PARENTHESES{h^{\PARENTHESES 1}\COVARIANTINDEX{ij}}
\]

\end_inset

 and this allows us to create a stress-energy for a gravitational wave with
 first order 
\begin_inset Formula $h\COVARIANTINDEX{ij}$
\end_inset

We take the average over a region of space-time that contains several gravitatio

 We take the following average: 
\begin_inset Formula

\]

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{\PARENTHESES 2}\COVARIANTINDEX{ij}\PARENTHESES{h^{\PARENTHESES 1}\COVARIANTINDEX{ij}}$
\end_inset

 has quadratic terms in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

.
 Now I have no idea what we use, but we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T^{\text{GW}}\COVARIANTINDEX{ij}=\frac{c^{4}}{32\pi G}\ANGLEBRACKETS{\frac{\partial h_{TT}\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\alpha\beta}}{\partial x\COVARIANTINDEX i}\frac{\partial h_{TT}\COVARIANTINDEX{\alpha\beta}}{\partial x\COVARIANTINDEX j}}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
h_{TT}\COVARIANTINDEX{\alpha\beta} & =h_{TT}\COVARIANTINDEX{\alpha\beta}\PARENTHESES{t-\frac{z}{c}}\\
 & =h_{+}e_{+}\COVARIANTINDEX{\alpha\beta}+h_{\times}e_{\times}\COVARIANTINDEX{\alpha\beta}

\end_inset

 is a wave propagating in the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$

 direction and 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{TT}$
\end_inset

 I think it means 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{\text{Transverse-Traceless}}$
\end_inset

, but not sure.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

 and all other components are zero.
 (We used that

\]

\end_inset

This is the integral we have to solve.
 We will solve this in two regimes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Far-zone: Means that 
\begin_inset Formula $R\ll\lambda\ll r$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is the source size and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 the distance we are looking from.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Near-zone: Means 
\begin_inset Formula $R\ll r\ll\lambda$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Far zone
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are using 
\begin_inset Formula $R\lll r$
\end_inset

 so the distance to the source is always the same: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\MODULE{\VECTOR x-\VECTOR x\PRIME}\approx r
\]

\end_inset

 We consider also slow motion: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
t-\frac{\MODULE{\VECTOR x-\VECTOR x\PRIME}}{c}\sim t-\frac{r}{c}
\]

\end_inset

 which in some way is a consequence from the previous assumption.
 In this conditions we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\bar{h}\COVARIANTINDEX{ij}=\frac{4G}{c^{4}r}\intop\tau\COVARIANTINDEX{ik}\PARENTHESES{t-\frac{r}{c},\VECTOR x\PRIME}\DIFERENTIAL^{3}x\PRIME
\]

\end_inset

 Now we approximate 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tau\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\alpha\beta}\approx\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial t^{2}}\PARENTHESES{x\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\alpha}x\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\beta}\tau\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{00}}
\]

\end_inset

 find 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\bar{h}\COVARIANTINDEX{\alpha\beta}=\frac{2G}{c^{4}r}\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial t^{2}}\GUNDERBRACE{\intop x\PRIME\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\alpha}x\PRIME\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\beta}\tau\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{00}\PARENTHESES{t-\frac{r}{c},\VECTOR x}\DIFERENTIAL^{3}x\PRIME}{\text{quadrupole tensor of GW}}
\]

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\bar{h}\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\alpha\beta}\sim\frac{2G}{c^{4}r}\ddot{I}\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\alpha\beta}\PARENTHESES{t-\frac{r}{c}}
\]

\end_inset

 Now we project into TT gauge 
\begin_inset Formula $P\COVARIANTINDEX{\alpha\beta}=\delta\COVARIANTINDEX{\alpha\beta}-\hat{\eta}\COVARIANTINDEX{\alpha}\hat{\eta}\COVARIANTINDEX{\beta}$
\end_inset

 and finally the solution in the near zone is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\boxed{\bar{h}_{TT}\COVARIANTINDEX{\alpha\beta}\sim\frac{2G}{c^{4}r}\ddot{I}_{TT}\COVARIANTINDEX{\alpha\beta}}
\]

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the near zone the gravitational potential to lowest order (Newtonian
 limit) is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\phi & =-\frac{c^{4}}{2}h\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{00}\\
 & =-\frac{c^{4}}{4}\PARENTHESES{\bar{h}\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{00}+\delta\COVARIANTINDEX{\alpha\beta}\frac{\bar{h}\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\alpha\beta}}{c^{2}}}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Here there was a long discussion, and we ended up with this: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\phi=-G\intop\frac{\tau\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{00}\PARENTHESES{t,\VECTOR x}+\frac{1}{c^{2}}\delta\COVARIANTINDEX{\alpha\beta}\tau\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\alpha\beta}\PARENTHESES{t,\VECTOR x}}{\MODULE{\VECTOR x-\VECTOR x\PRIME}}\DIFERENTIAL^{3}x\PRIME
\]

\end_inset

 Now we expand the denominator in powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{r}$
\end_inset

 because we are not in the far zone.
 (I think that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$

 run only on the spacial components.)

 Using this we get the expressions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 (3.165).
 This is

 & I\COVARIANTINDEX{22}=\frac{\mu a^{2}}{2}\PARENTHESES{1-\cos\PARENTHESES{2\varphi}}\\
 & I\COVARIANTINDEX{12}=\frac{\mu a^{2}}{2}\sin\PARENTHESES{2\varphi}

\end_inset

 Now we want to calculate the perturbation to the metric, this is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h^{TT}\COVARIANTINDEX{ij}\sim\frac{2G}{c^{4}r}\ddot{I}^{TT}\COVARIANTINDEX{ij}\PARENTHESES{t-\frac{r}{c}}

 Replacing the previous components we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h^{TT}\COVARIANTINDEX{ij}=-\frac{4G\mu a^{2}\omega^{2}}{c^{4}r}\SQBRACKETS{\begin{matrix}\cos2\varphi & \sin2\varphi & 0\\
\sin2\varphi & -\cos2\varphi & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0

\]

\end_inset

 We have used in the beginning that the observer is in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\VERSOR z$
\end_inset

 direction, thus we already have the 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 in the TT gauge.
 If we use the polarization tensors 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\LBRACE{\begin{aligned} & \VECTOR e_{+}=\SQBRACKETS{\begin{matrix}1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & -1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0

0 & 0 & 0

\end_inset

then each component has amplitude 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\LBRACE{\begin{aligned} & h_{+}=-\frac{4G\mu a^{2}\omega^{2}}{c^{4}r}\cos2\varphi\\

\begin_layout Standard
Now we want to see how this system evolves in time.
 Basically the gravitational radiation will carry energy, this will make
 the orbits to reduce, frequency increase and so on.
 To study this we need the gravitational wave luminosity, and for this we
 compute the third time derivative of the quadrupole tensor.
 The result is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
L_{\text{gravitational wave}} & =\frac{1}{5}\frac{G}{c^{5}}\ANGLEBRACKETS{\PARENTHESES{\ddddot{I}\COVARIANTINDEX{11}}^{2}+\PARENTHESES{\dddot{I}\COVARIANTINDEX{22}}^{2}+2\PARENTHESES{\dddot{I}\COVARIANTINDEX{12}}^{2}}\\
 & =\frac{32}{5}\frac{c^{5}}{G}\eta^{2}\PARENTHESES{\frac{v}{c}}^{10}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta\DEF\frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{M^{2}}$
\end_inset

.
 Now we can compute the energy using 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
L_{\text{GW}}=-\frac{\DIFERENTIAL E}{\DIFERENTIAL t}
\]

\end_inset

 and we use the Newtonian approximation for the energy 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
E & =\frac{m_{2}}{2}v_{1}^{2}+\frac{m_{2}}{2}v_{2}^{2}-\frac{Gm_{1}m_{2}}{a}\\
 & \,\vdots\\
 & =-\frac{\mu}{2}v^{2}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

 Combining these two expressions we get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\DIFERENTIAL\PARENTHESES{\frac{v}{c}}}{\DIFERENTIAL t}=\frac{32\eta}{5}\frac{c^{3}}{GM}\PARENTHESES{\frac{v}{c}}^{9}
\]

\end_inset

 Because we are using the Newtonian approximation, this is an approximation...
 But in the early moments of the merge we can use this formulas, i.e.
 when the two masses are enough far away from each other.

 for details.
 Don't know how accurate this is because the coalescence happens when the
 Newtonian approximation is not valid anymore.
 But this may happen for a short time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can also calculate the phase evolution.
 Because the gravitational wave is not monochromatic (because of the decay
 of the orbital motion) the phase will not be exactly a linear function
 increasing with time.
 The details of the calculation can be seen in the book.
 Basically with this we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi=\varphi\PARENTHESES v$
\end_inset

 and in the end 
\begin_inset Formula $\cos2\varphi\to\cos2\varphi\PARENTHESES v$
\end_inset

.
 Again, this is Newtonian so it is an approximation.
 In the post-Newtonian case the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}$
\end_inset

 are replaced by more complicated post-Newtonian expressions and the calculation
s are done numerically.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The post-Newtonian approximations, which are gradually getting better as
 the number of terms is increased, are used as ansatz.
 The merge of the two bodies is only modeled by full GR, and to get the
 wave forms for this you have to numerically solve full GR.
 But this is very expensive computationally, so you use post-Newtonian approxima
tions which are very cheap as ansatz and then you solve the full GR.

\end_inset

 As you add detectors to the network, 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 gets more uniform.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In real life the angle between the two arms of an interferometer are not
 exactly 
\begin_inset Formula $90\UNIT{deg}$
\end_inset

 because of technological constraints, geography, etc.
 So if this angle is 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 then we will have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\LBRACE{\begin{aligned} & F_{+}=\sin\eta\SQBRACKETS{a\cos^{2}\psi+b\sin^{2}\psi}\\
 & F_{\times}=\sin\eta\SQBRACKETS{a\cos^{2}\psi-b\sin^{2}\psi}
\end{aligned}
}
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 have complicated expressions, see the notes of the professor.
 The coordinates are 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta,\lambda$
\end_inset

 the longitude and latitude of the detector, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta\phi$
\end_inset

 the position of the source of GW.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Coincident and coherent formalism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have a set of signals 
\begin_inset Formula $h\PARENTHESES t$
\end_inset

 coming from each detector in the network, e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{L}\PARENTHESES t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{H}\PARENTHESES t$
\end_inset

 from Ligo, 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{V}\PARENTHESES t$
\end_inset

 from Virgo, and so on.
 How do we combine all these signals to see if there is something going
 on? We can use 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Coincident formalism.
 Basically you look for time coincidences in each 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

.
 We know GW go at the speed of light, we know the distance between each
 detector, we can compute a set of time windows withing the signals should
 be correlated if the are from the same event.
 Then we can look for such signals in all possible time windows in each
 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

.
 If we find something with a 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\SNR=\sqrt{\sum_{k}\SNR_{k}^{2}}
\]

\end_inset

 bigger than some value, we claim we have an event.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Coherent formalism.
 Here we not only use time coincidence but also two other things: The sky
 direction and the polarization.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Transient detection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How do we know that we have seen a GW transient? There are glitches that
 are of course not GW events but they look like GW events.
 To estimate the occurrence of these glitches (e.g.
 earthquakes, a car crash, etc) what you do is to shift your data from each
 detector with an exagerated 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t$
\end_inset

 such that the correlation between GW events is broken, and then you run
 your analyses algorithms.
 In this way you can estimate how often do glitches that look like GW happen
 in your array of detectors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So suppose we have two 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 signals from two detectors.
 We run our analysis algorithm and we find an event with some 
\begin_inset Formula $\SNR_{\text{candidate event}}$
\end_inset

.
 What is the chance that this was a random glitch and what is the chance
 it is an actual GW.
 What we do to measure the chance a totally random glitch will produce such
 an event is to shift one of the 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 in, say, 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 minutes (enough to break correlation of GW events) and then run the analysis
 algorithm.
 Then we repeat this for 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 minutes, and for 
\begin_inset Formula $4$
\end_inset

 minutes, and so on.
 In this way we produce many thousands of years of backgrand based in real
 data which we are completely sure it has no GW events, so here each event
 we detect with the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\SNR$
\end_inset

 is a fake event.
 With this we know how often our candidate event can be produced by a random
 glitch, say we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $10$
\end_inset

 glitches in 
\begin_inset Formula $100000$
\end_inset

 years of background, then we would expect to see our 
\begin_inset Formula $\SNR_{\text{candidate event}}$
\end_inset

 once every 10000 years due to random glitches.
 With this we can compute the significance of the event for each value of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\SNR$
\end_inset

.
 The lower the 
\begin_inset Formula $\SNR$
\end_inset

 the lower the significance.
 With this we can define the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

false alarm probability

\text{FAP}=1-\exp\PARENTHESES{-\frac{t_{\text{observation}}}{i\text{FAR}?}}

For this you need a signal that you can fit with a model.
 Thus, such signal must be somehow 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

happening all the time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Enumerate

Likelihood (SNR).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Template bank
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A bank of waveform models.
 These models should cover all the parameter space you want to explore (mass,
 spin, etc).
 You also need to know the power spectral density of your detector (to know
 how probable is that what you have fitted is a signal or just noise).
 The parameters space is discretized to produce the template bank, otherwise
 it would be infinite.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Parameter space.
 If we are looking for signals produced by binaries, our parameters space
 is composed by the two masses 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1},m_{2}$
\end_inset

, the 3 spin components of each mass 
\begin_inset Formula $\VECTOR s_{1},\VECTOR s_{2}$
\end_inset

, the eccentricity of the orbit which is one number.
 There can be other parameters depending on the model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The majority of the mergers happen with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

parallel spins
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, this means that 
\begin_inset Formula $\VECTOR s_{1}\parallel\VECTOR s_{2}\parallel\VECTOR L_{\text{Orbital}}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Eccentricity is usually 0.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The mass can be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

anything
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Usually we consider one of them to be 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{\text{high}}$
\end_inset

 and the other one to be 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{\text{low}}$
\end_inset

.
 Typical values for 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{\text{high}}\sim100M_{\sun}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{\text{low}}\sim1M_{\sun}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
We have to define how we will discretize the parameters space.
 Suppose we have two values of the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{2}$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=\BRACES{m_{1},m_{2},\VECTOR s_{1},\VECTOR s_{2},\dots}$
\end_inset

).
 With these parameters we produce two waveforms 
\begin_inset Formula $h\PARENTHESES{\theta_{1}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h\PARENTHESES{\theta_{2}}$
\end_inset

.
 We need a way of measuring the distance from 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{1}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{2}$
\end_inset

 in order to know how to properly discretize the parameters space.
 There are many fancy ways of doing this, here we will define the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

match
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\mu & =\PARENTHESES{\frac{h\PARENTHESES{\theta_{1}}}{\MODULE{\MODULE{h\PARENTHESES{\theta_{1}}}}}|\frac{h\PARENTHESES{\theta_{2}}}{\MODULE{\MODULE{h\PARENTHESES{\theta_{2}}}}}}\\
 & =4\REALPART{\intop_{f_{\text{low}}}^{f_{\text{high}}}\frac{\tilde{h}\PARENTHESES{\theta_{1}}\tilde{h}\PARENTHESES{\theta_{2}}}{\tilde{S}_{n}\PARENTHESES f}\DIFERENTIAL f}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{S}_{n}\PARENTHESES f$
\end_inset

 is the PSD and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{h}$
\end_inset

 are probably the Fourier transforms.
 This quantity is measuring how much SNR you looks if you use 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{2}$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 For example 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=0.9$
\end_inset

 tells that you loose 
\begin_inset Formula $10\UNIT{\%}$
\end_inset

 of SNR.

Numerical relativity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 1952 it was probed that the EFE in vacuum are well posed, i.e.
 that there is solution and that small changes in initial conditions produce
 small changes in solutions so this is stable and continuous.

The EFE are 10 quasi-linear wave-like equations with hyperbolic stability
 properties.

\begin_inset Formula $\DIFERENTIAL s^{2}=g\COVARIANTINDEX{\mu\nu}\DIFERENTIAL x\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\mu}\DIFERENTIAL x\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{\nu}$
\end_inset

 In 3+1 formalism this is written as 
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_inset Formula $\gamma\CONTRAVARIANTINDEX{ij}$

 are 3 dimensions metrics and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha,\beta\COVARIANTINDEX i$

 are gauge variables.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lapse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and measures the rate in proper time progression between two slices of
 spacetime while 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\COVARIANTINDEX i$
\end_inset

 is sthe shift vector and measures the change of spacial coordinates between
 different slices.
 See the previous figure.
 The lapse 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

 has to be chosen in order to avoid singularities, improve convergence and
 speed up the simulation.

With this formalism there are two types of equations:

Hyperbolic, i.e.
 wave-like equations.
 These are nice because they have a rapid convergence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Parabolic, i.e.
 time-dependent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These problems are mathematically stable once initial constraints are satisfied.
 However in full GR there is a lot of non-linearity and the small numerical
 computational errors can blow up.
 This blow up due to the non-linearity is the challenge of numerical relativity.
 For this we have to keep the constraints satisfied at all times and this
 guaranties that stable and convergent solutions exist.

Suitable initial conditions

\begin_layout Subsubsection
BSSNOK approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is one problem which is to propose suitable initial conditions.
 This was solved during the 1990s by Baugmarde, Shapiro (1998) and Shibala,
 Nakamura (1995) in the so called BSSNOK approach.
 The problem is that we have 12 real numbers that are the initial data for
 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma\COVARIANTINDEX{ij}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $K\COVARIANTINDEX{ij}$
\end_inset

.
 These numbers are not all independent, they are related to the parameters
 of the system, e.g.
 the mass and spin of the black holes, and the initial orbit dynamics.
 We want to know how are they related so we can solve the problem.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Generalized harmonic coordinates with constraint damping (GHCD)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 There are two unstable scalar field profiles: initial amplitudes, boosts,
 separaitons.

Excision
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is one way of solving the singularities problem.
 We have different types of black holes, Schwarzschild and Kerr.
 Both have event horizons that shield the singularities.
 What we do is to simulate outside the event horizon if I understood correctly.
 (Unruh 1984)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are challenging boundary conditions due to irregular shape of black
 hole horizons.
 This creates numerical artifacts and in particular emission of gravitational
 waves that is unphysical.
 To mitigate this problem you have to fine tune the constraints.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Punctures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is another way of solving the singularities problem.
 This solution was introduced by Hahn, Lindquist in 1964 axisymmetric coalescenc
e of two black holes.
 Here you somehow design your space time such that the solution avoids the
 singularities using wormholes, or something similar.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This technique lead to the first successful simulation of two black holes,
 not until 2005.
 Some modifications to the original punctures approach were done, for example
 letting the punctures to freely move in the coordinates system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Discretization and gridding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is another problem.
 In the initial problem, probably after a Newtonian ansatz, there are two
 BH well separated in a flat spacetime.
 Then you evolve the simulation and you go into coalescence where the two
 black holes are close and the space time is highly curved.
 The two situations have very different length scales so the numerical mesh
 that we take in each case has to be very different.

residuals test
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which is basically to look at 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{data}-\text{model}$
\end_inset

.
 If the model is good, you will only see noise here, if there is something
 wrong in your model, you will see not just noise but a component of the
 signal that is not in the model.

We can also do a

\end_inset

least-damped QNM
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which looks if the data is consistent with GR prediction of QNMs (quasi
 normal modes) of the remnant black hole.
 For this there is a signal model for 
\begin_inset Formula $t>t_{0}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the time at which the QNM start, and loos like 
\begin_inset Formula $h\PARENTHESES t\sim e^{-\frac{t-t_{0}}{\tau}}\cos\PARENTHESES{2\pi f_{0}\PARENTHESES{t-t_{0}}+\phi_{0}}$
\end_inset

.

Waveform self-consistengy.
 There is a prediction for the waveform and it has to be consistent.
 This means that if we estimate the final mass and spin of the black hole

Massive graviton? If the graviton is massive, there should be dispersion
 in the propagation of gravitational waves.
 Up to now there is on evidence for dispersion and

Parameterized deviations from GR.
 This I think it is basically to see if other things that are not exactly
 GR fit better the data than GR does.

Difference in the speed of light and gravity.
 This is done combining data from gravitational wave and electromagnetic
 observations of the same event, and then we can compare the time of arrival
 of each.
